# Use Case UC-03: Authenticate Registered Users

## Goal
A registered user logs in with email and password to access the personalized dashboard.

## Preconditions
- User account exists.
- User is not already authenticated.

## Main Success Scenario
1. User opens login form.
2. User submits email and password.
3. System validates required fields.
4. System looks up credentials.
5. System verifies password.
6. System creates authenticated session.
7. System redirects user to dashboard/home.
8. Protected pages remain accessible while session is active.

## Extensions
- Missing email/password: reject with required-field feedback.
- Unknown email: reject with generic invalid-credentials message.
- Wrong password: reject with generic invalid-credentials message.
- Repeated failures: enforce lockout policy (5 failures, 15-minute lockout window).
- Credential store unavailable: reject with retry-later system message.

## Success End Condition
User is authenticated and can access protected dashboard resources.

## Failed End Condition
User remains unauthenticated and receives clear, non-sensitive feedback.
