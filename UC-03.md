# Use Case UC-03: Log in to CMS

**Goal in Context**: A registered user authenticates with their username (email) and password so they can access their personalized dashboard/home page.  
**Scope**: Conference Management System (CMS)  
**Level**: User Goal  
**Primary Actor**: Registered User  
**Secondary Actors**: Database (credential store)  
**Trigger**: The user requests to log in to the system.

## Success End Condition
* The user is authenticated and is redirected to their personalized dashboard/home page.

## Failed End Condition
* The user is not authenticated, remains on the login page, and is informed of the reason for failure.

## Preconditions
* The user has a registered account in the CMS.
* The user is not currently authenticated (not logged in).

## Main Success Scenario
1. The registered user selects the option to log in.
2. The system prompts the user to enter their username (email) and password.
3. The user enters their username and password and submits the login form.
4. The system retrieves the registered credentials for the submitted username from the database.
5. The system compares the submitted credentials with the stored credentials.
6. The system authenticates the user.
7. The system redirects the user to their personalized dashboard/home page.

## Extensions
* **3a**: Username and/or password is missing  
  * **3a1**: The system displays an error message indicating required fields are missing and prompts the user to complete them.
* **4a**: Username does not exist  
  * **4a1**: The system displays an error message indicating the username is not recognized and prompts the user to try again.
* **5a**: Username exists but password does not match  
  * **5a1**: The system displays an error message indicating the credentials are invalid and prompts the user to try again.
* **4b**: The system cannot access the credential store (database/service error)  
  * **4b1**: The system displays an error message indicating a system problem and prompts the user to retry later.

## Related Information
* **Priority**: High  
* **Frequency**: Frequent (whenever registered users access the CMS)  
* **Open Issues**:
  * The SRS does not specify whether the username is strictly the user’s email, but registration requires a unique email and login uses “username and password.”  
  * The SRS does not specify lockout, rate limiting, or multi-factor authentication behavior for repeated failures.
