# Use Case UC-02: Validate User-Provided Information

## Goal
Ensure submitted form data is validated before persistence so invalid, incomplete, or inconsistent inputs are rejected safely.

## Preconditions
- User is authenticated.
- Target form is part of the UC-02 in-scope form catalog.

## Main Success Scenario
1. User submits create/update form data.
2. System validates required fields from form metadata.
3. System validates field formats and inline constraints.
4. System validates business/cross-field rules.
5. If all checks pass, system persists write atomically.
6. System returns success confirmation.

## Extensions
- Missing required fields: reject with field-specific required guidance.
- Invalid formats: reject with field-specific format guidance.
- Business-rule violations: reject with explicit rule guidance.
- Mixed failures: return all errors in stable deterministic order.
- Persistence failure after pass: rollback/abort and return retry guidance.
- Concurrent conflicting updates: last-write-wins final persisted state.

## Success End Condition
Only valid submissions are fully persisted; user receives success confirmation.

## Failed End Condition
Submission is rejected with deterministic, field-level feedback and no partial writes.
