# Use Case UC-02: Validate User-Provided Information

**Goal in Context**: Ensure submitted form data is validated before persistence so invalid, incomplete, or inconsistent inputs are rejected safely.  
**Scope**: Conference Management System (CMS)  
**Level**: User Goal  
**Primary Actor**: User  
**Secondary Actors**: CMS services, data store  
**Trigger**: The primary actor initiates this use case.

## Success End Condition
* Only valid submissions are fully persisted; user receives success confirmation.

## Failed End Condition
* Submission is rejected with deterministic, field-level feedback and no partial writes.

## Preconditions
* User is authenticated.
* Target form is part of the UC-02 in-scope form catalog.

## Main Success Scenario
1. User submits create/update form data.
2. System validates required fields from form metadata.
3. System validates field formats and inline constraints.
4. System validates business/cross-field rules.
5. If all checks pass, system persists write atomically.
6. System returns success confirmation.

## Extensions
* **1a**: Missing required fields: reject with field-specific required guidance.
* **2a**: Invalid formats: reject with field-specific format guidance.
* **3a**: Business-rule violations: reject with explicit rule guidance.
* **4a**: Mixed failures: return all errors in stable deterministic order.
* **5a**: Persistence failure after pass: rollback/abort and return retry guidance.
* **6a**: Concurrent conflicting updates: last-write-wins final persisted state.
