# Use Case UC-02: Validate user-provided information

**Goal in Context**: A registered user submits information to the CMS and the system validates data so invalid, incomplete, or inconsistent information is rejected before storage.  
**Scope**: Conference Management System (CMS)  
**Level**: User Goal  
**Primary Actor**: Registered User  
**Secondary Actors**: Database  
**Trigger**: User submits information through an in-scope CMS form.

## Success End Condition

- Submission passes required, format, and business-rule validation.
- Full create/update write is persisted and success confirmation is shown.

## Failed End Condition

- Submission is rejected with deterministic, field-specific feedback.
- No partial create/update write is persisted.

## Preconditions

- User is authenticated.
- Target form is in UC-02 in-scope form catalog.

## Main Success Scenario

1. User enters data into CMS form.
2. User submits form.
3. System validates required fields from form metadata.
4. System validates formats/constraints from form inline rules.
5. System validates business/cross-field rules.
6. If all validations pass, system persists full create/update atomically.
7. System confirms success.

## Extensions

- **3a** Required fields missing
  - **3a1** System returns field-specific missing-field feedback.
- **4a** Invalid format detected
  - **4a1** System returns field-specific format feedback.
- **5a** Business/constraint rule violation
  - **5a1** System returns field-specific rule violation feedback.
- **3b/4b/5b** Mixed failures in one submit
  - **3b1** System returns all field-level errors in stable order.
- **6a** Any validation failure during update
  - **6a1** No partial update persists.
- **6b** Persistence failure after validation pass
  - **6b1** System rolls back/aborts atomically and provides retry guidance.
- **6c** Concurrent conflicting updates
  - **6c1** Last-write-wins policy defines final persisted state.
