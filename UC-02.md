# Use Case UC-02: Validate user-provided information

**Goal in Context**: A registered user submits information to the CMS and the system validates the data so that invalid, incomplete, or inconsistent information is rejected before being stored or processed.  
**Scope**: Conference Management System (CMS)  
**Level**: User Goal  
**Primary Actor**: Registered User  
**Secondary Actors**: Database  
**Trigger**: The registered user submits information through a CMS form.

## Success End Condition
* The submitted information is validated successfully and accepted by the system for storage or further processing.

## Failed End Condition
* The submitted information is rejected, no data is stored or updated, and the user is informed of validation errors.

## Preconditions
* The user is authenticated and logged into the CMS.
* The user has access to a CMS form that accepts user-provided information.

## Main Success Scenario
1. The registered user enters information into a CMS form.
2. The user submits the form.
3. The system checks all required fields for completeness.
4. The system validates the format and constraints of the submitted data.
5. The system confirms that all information is valid.
6. The system stores or updates the validated information in the database.
7. The system confirms successful submission to the user.

## Extensions
* **3a**: One or more required fields are missing  
  * **3a1**: The system highlights the missing fields and displays an error message prompting the user to complete them.
* **4a**: One or more fields contain invalid data formats  
  * **4a1**: The system displays an error message indicating which fields are invalid and why.
* **4b**: Submitted data violates system constraints or business rules  
  * **4b1**: The system displays an appropriate error message and prevents data storage.

## Related Information
* **Priority**: High  
* **Frequency**: Frequent (whenever a registered user submits or updates information)  
* **Open Issues**:
  * Specific validation rules vary depending on the form and are not fully enumerated in the SRS.
