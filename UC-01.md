# Use Case UC-01: Register new user account

**Goal in Context**: A new user creates a CMS account by providing a unique, valid email address and a secure password so they can access CMS features beyond public announcements.  
**Scope**: Conference Management System (CMS)  
**Level**: User Goal  
**Primary Actor**: New User (Public user becoming an authorized user)  
**Secondary Actors**: Database  
**Trigger**: The user requests to be registered on the system.

## Success End Condition
* A new user account is successfully created and stored in the database with a unique email and a secure password, and the user is redirected to the login screen.

## Failed End Condition
* No user account is created, and the user remains on the registration page with appropriate error messages displayed.

## Preconditions
* The CMS registration feature is available.
* The user is not currently authenticated (not logged in).

## Main Success Scenario
1. The user selects the option to register.
2. The system redirects the user to the registration webpage/form.
3. The user fills out the registration form with required information and submits it.
4. The system validates the email address for correct format and uniqueness.
5. The system validates the password against defined password security standards.
6. The system stores the new user information in the database.
7. The system redirects the user to the login screen.

## Extensions
* **4a**: Email address format is invalid  
  * **4a1**: The system displays an error message indicating the email format is invalid and prompts the user to correct it.
* **4b**: Email address already exists in the system  
  * **4b1**: The system displays an error message indicating the email is already registered and prompts the user to enter a different email.
* **5a**: Password does not meet security standards  
  * **5a1**: The system displays an error message describing the password requirements and prompts the user to update the password.
* **3a**: One or more required fields are missing or invalid  
  * **3a1**: The system highlights the invalid or missing fields and prompts the user to correct them.

## Related Information
* **Priority**: High  
* **Frequency**: Occasional (whenever a new user registers)  
* **Open Issues**:
