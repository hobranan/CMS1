# Use Case UC-01: Register New User Account

**Goal in Context**: A new user registers with a unique email and secure password, verifies email ownership, and then can log in.  
**Scope**: Conference Management System (CMS)  
**Level**: User Goal  
**Primary Actor**: User  
**Secondary Actors**: CMS services, data store  
**Trigger**: The primary actor initiates this use case.

## Success End Condition
* Account is activated only after verification and user can authenticate immediately.

## Failed End Condition
* No active account is created; user receives explicit correction/retry guidance.

## Preconditions
* User is unauthenticated.
* Registration service is available.

## Main Success Scenario
1. User opens registration.
2. System shows form with `email`, `password`, `confirm password`.
3. User submits valid values.
4. System validates required fields, email format, uniqueness, and password policy.
5. System creates pending registration and sends verification link.
6. User opens verification link within 24 hours.
7. System verifies token, activates account, and redirects to login.
8. User logs in successfully.

## Extensions

* **2a**: Duplicate email (active or pending): reject deterministically, no duplicate pending account.
* **3a**: Password rule failure: show policy guidance, no pending account creation.
* **4a**: Missing or mixed invalid fields: return all field errors in stable order.
* **5a**: Login before verification: deny login, show verification reminder, offer resend when eligible.
* **6a**: Link expired (`>=24h` UTC): reject verification and offer resend.
