# Use Case UC-16: Generate Conference Schedule

## Goal
An authorized admin/editor manually generates a conference schedule draft from accepted papers, reviews conflicts, and publishes the schedule.

## Preconditions
- User is authenticated as admin/editor.
- Conference has accepted papers.
- Required room and slot parameters are configured.

## Main Flow
1. User triggers schedule generation manually.
2. System validates conference inputs.
3. System builds one column per room with equal sequential slots.
4. System randomizes initial paper placement.
5. System stores a draft schedule and returns conflict highlights.
6. User reviews draft and confirms publish.
7. System publishes draft when no blocking conflicts remain.
8. Published schedule is retrievable.

## Extensions
- No accepted papers: block with setup error.
- Missing parameters: block with setup error.
- Save failure: return system error and persist nothing.
- Blocking conflicts: prevent publish until resolved.
- Cancel publish: leave draft unpublished.

## Success End Condition
Published schedule is available for retrieval.

## Failure End Condition
No published schedule is produced and blocking/error feedback is returned.
