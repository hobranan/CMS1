# Use Case UC-16: Generate conference schedule

**Goal in Context**: An administrator or editor generates a conference schedule so that accepted papers are organized into presentation sessions.  
**Scope**: Conference Management System (CMS)  
**Level**: User Goal  
**Primary Actor**: Administrator / Editor  
**Secondary Actors**: Database (papers, sessions, schedule), Scheduling Engine (business rules), Notification Service (optional publication notifications)  
**Trigger**: The administrator/editor selects the option to generate the conference schedule.

## Success End Condition
* A conference schedule is generated successfully, organizing accepted papers into sessions with assigned times and locations.

## Failed End Condition
* The schedule is not generated, or is only partially generated, and the administrator/editor is informed of the reason.

## Preconditions
* The administrator/editor is registered and authenticated.
* A set of papers has been accepted.
* Conference parameters (dates, available rooms, session durations) are defined.

## Main Success Scenario
1. The administrator/editor navigates to the conference scheduling section.
2. The administrator/editor selects **Generate Schedule**.
3. The system retrieves accepted papers and conference parameters.
4. The system applies scheduling rules (session lengths, room availability, conflicts).
5. The system assigns papers to sessions with times and locations.
6. The system stores the generated schedule in the database.
7. The system displays the generated schedule for review.
8. The administrator/editor confirms and publishes the schedule.

## Extensions
* **3a**: No accepted papers available  
  * **3a1**: The system displays a message indicating that no schedule can be generated.
* **3b**: Conference parameters incomplete or missing  
  * **3b1**: The system blocks schedule generation and prompts configuration completion.
* **4a**: Scheduling conflicts detected (e.g., room/time overlap)  
  * **4a1**: The system highlights conflicts and requests manual adjustment.
* **6a**: Database error occurs while saving the schedule  
  * **6a1**: The system displays a system error message and does not store the schedule.
* **8a**: Administrator/editor cancels before publishing  
  * **8a1**: The schedule remains in draft state and is not published.

## Related Information
* **Priority**: Medium–High  
* **Frequency**: Once per conference (or per scheduling iteration)  
* **Open Issues**:
  * The SRS does not specify whether scheduling is fully automatic or semi-manual.
  * The SRS does not define conflict resolution strategies.
