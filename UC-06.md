# Use Case UC-06: Upload manuscript in an allowed format

**Goal in Context**: An author uploads a manuscript file in an allowed format and size so the submission meets CMS requirements.  
**Scope**: Conference Management System (CMS)  
**Level**: User Goal  
**Primary Actor**: Author (Registered User)  
**Secondary Actors**: File Storage, Database  
**Trigger**: The author chooses to upload a manuscript file during paper submission.

## Success End Condition
- The manuscript file is uploaded, validated, and attached to the current submission.

## Failed End Condition
- The manuscript file is not attached, and the author is informed how to correct and retry.

## Preconditions
- The author is authenticated.
- The author is in the submission workflow.
- The author has a local manuscript file.

## Main Success Scenario
1. The author opens the manuscript upload section.
2. The author selects a file from their device.
3. The system validates extension against allowed list: `.pdf`, `.doc`, `.docx`, `.tex` (case-insensitive).
4. The system validates file size against the 7 MB limit.
5. The system uploads the file to storage.
6. The system associates the uploaded file with the current submission.
7. The system confirms successful attachment.

## Extensions
- **2a**: Author cancels file selection  
  - **2a1**: No upload occurs and attachment state is unchanged.
- **3a**: File extension is not allowed  
  - **3a1**: System rejects file and shows allowed extensions.
- **4a**: File exceeds 7 MB  
  - **4a1**: System rejects file and shows size-limit error.
- **5a**: Upload interrupted (network/time-out)  
  - **5a1**: System shows retry guidance and keeps file unattached.
- **5b**: Upload fails (storage/service error)  
  - **5b1**: System shows system error and keeps file unattached.
- **6a**: Upload succeeds but association fails  
  - **6a1**: System reports file not attached and prompts retry.

## Related Information
- **Priority**: High  
- **Frequency**: Frequent during submission window  
- **Resolved Decisions**:
  - File validation is by extension only.
  - Allowed extensions are `.pdf`, `.doc`, `.docx`, `.tex`.
  - Interrupted uploads can resume within 30 minutes for the same file; after 30 minutes restart from beginning.
