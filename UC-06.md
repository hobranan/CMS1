# Use Case UC-06: Upload manuscript in an allowed format

**Goal in Context**: An author uploads a manuscript file in an allowed format and size so the submission meets CMS requirements.  
**Scope**: Conference Management System (CMS)  
**Level**: User Goal  
**Primary Actor**: Author (Registered User)  
**Secondary Actors**: File Storage, Database  
**Trigger**: The author chooses to upload a manuscript file during paper submission.

## Success End Condition
* The manuscript file is uploaded, validated, and attached to the current submission.

## Failed End Condition
* The manuscript file is not attached, and the author is informed how to correct and retry.

## Preconditions
* The author is authenticated.
* The author is in the submission workflow.
* The author has a local manuscript file.

## Main Success Scenario
1. The author opens the manuscript upload section.
2. The author selects a file from their device.
3. The system validates extension against allowed list: `.pdf`, `.doc`, `.docx`, `.tex` (case-insensitive).
4. The system validates file size against the 7 MB limit.
5. The system uploads the file to storage.
6. The system associates the uploaded file with the current submission.
7. The system confirms successful attachment.

## Extensions
* **1a**: Author cancels file selection
* **1b**: No upload occurs and attachment state is unchanged.
* **1c**: File extension is not allowed
* **1d**: System rejects file and shows allowed extensions.
* **1e**: File exceeds 7 MB
* **1f**: System rejects file and shows size-limit error.
* **1g**: Upload interrupted (network/time-out)
* **1h**: System shows retry guidance and keeps file unattached.
* **1i**: Upload fails (storage/service error)
  * **1i1**: System shows system error and keeps file unattached.
* **1j**: Upload succeeds but association fails
  * **1j1**: System reports file not attached and prompts retry.
