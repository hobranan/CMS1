# Use Case UC-06: Upload manuscript in an allowed format

**Goal in Context**: An author uploads a manuscript file in an allowed format (PDF, Word, or LaTeX) and within the system’s size constraints so the submission meets CMS requirements.  
**Scope**: Conference Management System (CMS)  
**Level**: User Goal  
**Primary Actor**: Author (Registered User)  
**Secondary Actors**: File Storage (upload storage), Database (stores file reference/metadata)  
**Trigger**: The author chooses to upload a manuscript file during paper submission.

## Success End Condition
* The manuscript file is uploaded successfully, validated as an allowed type and size, and is attached to the author’s paper submission.

## Failed End Condition
* The manuscript file is not accepted/attached (upload rejected or fails), and the author is informed of the reason so they can correct and retry.

## Preconditions
* The author is registered and authenticated (logged in).
* The author is on the paper submission workflow/page (or another page that supports manuscript upload).
* The author has a manuscript file available locally.

## Main Success Scenario
1. The author navigates to the manuscript upload section of the submission form.
2. The author selects a manuscript file from their device.
3. The system checks the selected file’s type/extension to ensure it is PDF, Word, or LaTeX.
4. The system checks the selected file size against the maximum allowed size.
5. The system uploads the file to storage.
6. The system records the file reference/metadata in the database and associates it with the current submission.
7. The system displays confirmation that the manuscript upload succeeded and the file is attached.

## Extensions
* **2a**: The author cancels the file selection  
  * **2a1**: The system leaves the upload section unchanged; no file is attached.
* **3a**: File type is not allowed (not PDF/Word/LaTeX)  
  * **3a1**: The system rejects the file and displays an error message indicating allowed formats.
* **4a**: File exceeds the maximum allowed size  
  * **4a1**: The system rejects the file and displays an error message indicating the size limit.
* **5a**: Upload fails due to network interruption/time-out  
  * **5a1**: The system displays an upload failure message and prompts the author to retry.
* **5b**: Upload fails due to storage/service error  
  * **5b1**: The system displays a system error message and advises the author to retry later.
* **6a**: The system cannot associate the uploaded file with the submission (database error)  
  * **6a1**: The system informs the author that the file could not be attached and prompts retry (the file is not considered attached to the submission).

## Related Information
* **Priority**: High  
* **Frequency**: Frequent during paper submission (each submission requires an upload)  
* **Open Issues**:
  * The SRS specifies allowed formats and a maximum size, but does not define whether validation is by extension, MIME type, or content inspection.  
  * The SRS does not specify resumable upload behavior for interrupted transfers.
