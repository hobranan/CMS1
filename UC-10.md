# Use Case UC-10: Respond to review invitation (accept or reject)

**Goal in Context**: A referee responds to a review invitation by accepting or rejecting it so they can control their review commitments and workload.  
**Scope**: Conference Management System (CMS)  
**Level**: User Goal  
**Primary Actor**: Referee (Registered User)  
**Secondary Actors**: Database (invitations, assignments), Email/Notification Service (invitation/confirmation notifications)  
**Trigger**: The referee receives a review invitation and chooses to respond to it.

## Success End Condition
* The referee’s response (accept or reject) is recorded, the invitation status is updated, and relevant parties are notified as required.

## Failed End Condition
* The referee’s response is not recorded (invitation status unchanged), and the referee is informed of the reason for failure.

## Preconditions
* The referee is registered and authenticated (logged in).
* A pending review invitation exists for the referee.
* The invitation is still open (not expired, withdrawn, or already responded to).
* Invitation expiry is evaluated server-side in UTC.

## Main Success Scenario
1. The referee navigates to their list of pending review invitations.
2. The referee selects a specific invitation to view details.
3. The system displays the invitation details and provides options to **Accept** or **Reject**.
4. The referee selects either **Accept** or **Reject**.
5. The system validates that the invitation is still pending and the action is allowed.
6. The system records the referee’s response and updates the invitation status.
7. If the referee accepted, the system activates the review assignment for the paper (making it visible in the referee’s assigned papers list).
8. The system notifies the editor (and optionally the referee) that the invitation was accepted/rejected.
9. The system displays confirmation to the referee.

## Extensions
* **1a**: No pending invitations are available
* **1a1**: The system informs the referee that there are no pending invitations.
* **5a**: Invitation is no longer pending (expired, withdrawn, or already responded to)
* **5a1**: The system prevents the action and displays a message indicating the invitation cannot be responded to.
* **4a**: Referee cancels the action before confirming (e.g., navigates away)
* **4a1**: The system makes no changes and the invitation remains pending.
* **6a**: System cannot update invitation status due to database error
* **6a1**: The system displays a system error message; no response is recorded.
* **8a**: Notification service fails after response is recorded
* **8a1**: The system informs the referee that notifications could not be sent; the response remains recorded.
## Related Information
* **Priority**: High  
* **Frequency**: Frequent during the review invitation period  
* **Open Issues**:
  * Invitation expiry is fixed at 14 days and evaluated server-side in UTC.
  * The SRS does not specify whether a referee can change their response after initially accepting or rejecting.
