# Use Case UC-15: Receive final decision notification

**Goal in Context**: An author receives the final acceptance or rejection decision for their submitted paper so they know the outcome of the review process.  
**Scope**: Conference Management System (CMS)  
**Level**: User Goal  
**Primary Actor**: Author (Registered User)  
**Secondary Actors**: Database (paper status, decisions), Notification Service (email/in-app notifications)  
**Trigger**: A final decision is recorded for a paper submitted by the author.

## Success End Condition
* The author is informed of the paper’s final decision (Accepted or Rejected) and can view the decision details.

## Failed End Condition
* The author does not receive or cannot access the final decision information, and is informed of the issue if possible.

## Preconditions
* The author is registered and authenticated.
* The author has submitted at least one paper.
* A final decision has been recorded for the paper by an editor.

## Main Success Scenario
1. The editor records a final decision for the paper.
2. The system updates the paper status to **Accepted** or **Rejected**.
3. The system generates a notification for the author.
4. The author logs into the CMS or receives an in-app/email notification.
5. The author navigates to their submitted papers list.
6. The author selects the paper.
7. The system displays the final decision and any accompanying decision comments.

## Extensions
* **4a**: Notification delivery fails  
  * **4a1**: The system still makes the decision visible in the CMS when the author logs in.
* **5a**: Author attempts to view decision before it is available  
  * **5a1**: The system indicates that the paper is still under review.
* **6a**: Author attempts to access a paper they do not own  
  * **6a1**: The system blocks access and displays an authorization error.
* **7a**: Decision details cannot be retrieved due to system error  
  * **7a1**: The system displays a system error message and advises retry later.

## Related Information
* **Priority**: High  
* **Frequency**: Once per paper  
* **Open Issues**:
  * The SRS does not specify whether decision notifications include full reviews or only a summary.
