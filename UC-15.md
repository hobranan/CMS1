# Use Case UC-15: Receive Final Decision Notification

**Goal in Context**: An author receives the final acceptance or rejection decision for their submitted paper so they know the outcome of the review process.  
**Scope**: Conference Management System (CMS)  
**Level**: User Goal  
**Primary Actor**: Author (Registered User)  
**Secondary Actors**: Database (paper status, decisions), Notification Service (in-app/email)  
**Trigger**: An editor records a final decision for a submitted paper.

## Success End Condition
* The author can view the paper's final decision and related decision details.

## Failed End Condition
* The author cannot access final decision information and receives clear feedback.

## Preconditions
* The author is registered and authenticated.
* The author has submitted at least one paper.
* A final decision has been recorded for the paper by an editor.

## Main Success Scenario
1. The editor records a final decision for the paper.
2. The system updates the paper status to **Accepted** or **Rejected**.
3. The system generates a decision notification for the author.
4. The author logs into CMS or receives the supported notification.
5. The author opens the submitted paper details.
6. The system displays the final decision and any decision comment.
7. The system displays notification content with important summary bullet notes first, then the full review content from the same decision source.

## Extensions
- **4a**: Notification delivery fails  
  - **4a1**: The decision still appears in CMS when the author logs in.
- **5a**: Author tries to view decision before it exists  
  - **5a1**: The system shows that the paper is still under review.
- **5b**: Author tries to access a paper they do not own  
  - **5b1**: The system blocks access and shows an authorization error.
- **6a**: Decision details cannot be retrieved because of a system error  
  - **6a1**: The system shows a retry-later error and withholds decision details.
