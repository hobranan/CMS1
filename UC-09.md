# Use Case UC-09: Enforce referee workload limits

**Goal in Context**: The system prevents assigning too many papers to a single referee so that review workload is balanced and conference review quality is maintained.  
**Scope**: Conference Management System (CMS)  
**Level**: User Goal  
**Primary Actor**: Editor  
**Secondary Actors**: Database (referee assignments, workload counts)  
**Trigger**: The editor attempts to assign a referee to a paper.

## Success End Condition
* Referees are only assigned if their workload is within the allowed limit, ensuring balanced distribution of review tasks.

## Failed End Condition
* The referee assignment is rejected because the referee has reached or exceeded the maximum allowed workload, and no invalid assignment is stored.

## Preconditions
* The editor is registered and authenticated.
* A paper is available for referee assignment.
* The system has a defined maximum workload per referee.

## Main Success Scenario
1. The editor selects a paper for referee assignment.
2. The editor selects a referee to assign to the paper.
3. The system retrieves the current workload (number of assigned papers) for the selected referee.
4. The system checks the workload against the maximum allowed limit.
5. The system determines the referee is within the allowed workload.
6. The system allows the assignment to proceed and stores the assignment.

## Extensions
* **5a**: Referee has reached the maximum allowed workload  
  * **5a1**: The system prevents the assignment and displays an error message indicating the workload limit has been reached.
* **3a**: Workload information cannot be retrieved (database error)  
  * **3a1**: The system displays a system error message and prevents the assignment.
* **6a**: Assignment fails during storage  
  * **6a1**: The system displays a system error message and does not store the assignment.

## Related Information
* **Priority**: High  
* **Frequency**: Frequent during referee assignment phase  
* **Open Issues**:
  * The SRS specifies a maximum workload but does not define whether limits are strict or configurable.
