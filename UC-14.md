# Use Case UC-14: Record Paper Decision

## Goal in Context
An editor records a final Accept/Reject decision so authors can be notified and the paper status is finalized.

## Primary Actor
Editor

## Preconditions
- Editor is authenticated.
- Paper exists and belongs to the editor.
- Decision period is open.
- At least one completed review exists unless an explicit override is used.

## Main Flow
1. Editor opens a paper decision page.
2. System shows completed-review count and decision options.
3. Editor selects `Accept` or `Reject` and may add a comment.
4. Editor confirms.
5. System revalidates eligibility at confirmation time.
6. System persists decision and updates paper status atomically.
7. System attempts author notification.
8. System confirms saved decision and reports notification outcome.

## Extensions
- No completed reviews and no override: block decision with explanation.
- Paper already decided: return conflict and keep existing status.
- Decision period closed: block decision.
- Cancel before confirmation: no mutation.
- Save failure: return error, keep status unchanged.
- Notification failure: decision remains committed with failed notification status.

## Success End Condition
Decision is stored and paper status is updated to `accepted` or `rejected`.

## Failure End Condition
Decision is not stored and paper status remains unchanged.
