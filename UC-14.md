# Use Case UC-14: Make acceptance decision for a paper

**Goal in Context**: An editor accepts or rejects a paper so that authors are informed of the final decision and the review process is concluded.  
**Scope**: Conference Management System (CMS)  
**Level**: User Goal  
**Primary Actor**: Editor  
**Secondary Actors**: Database (paper status, decisions), Notification Service (author notifications)  
**Trigger**: The editor decides to record a final decision for a reviewed paper.

## Success End Condition
* The paper’s status is updated to Accepted or Rejected, the decision is stored, and the author(s) are notified of the outcome.

## Failed End Condition
* The decision is not recorded, the paper status remains unchanged, and the editor is informed of the failure.

## Preconditions
* The editor is registered and authenticated (logged in).
* The paper exists and is under the editor’s responsibility.
* At least one completed review exists for the paper (unless editorial override is allowed).
* The decision period is open.

## Main Success Scenario
1. The editor navigates to the list of submitted papers.
2. The editor selects a paper that is ready for decision.
3. The system displays the paper details, completed reviews, and decision options.
4. The editor selects a decision: **Accept** or **Reject**.
5. The editor optionally enters a decision comment for the author(s).
6. The editor confirms the decision.
7. The system validates that the decision is allowed.
8. The system stores the decision and updates the paper status accordingly.
9. The system notifies the author(s) of the decision.
10. The system displays confirmation that the decision has been recorded.

## Extensions
* **3a**: No completed reviews are available  
  * **3a1**: The system warns the editor that no reviews are completed and blocks the decision (unless override is allowed).
* **4a**: Editor cancels the decision before confirmation  
  * **4a1**: The system makes no changes; the paper status remains unchanged.
* **7a**: Decision is not allowed (paper already decided or decision period closed)  
  * **7a1**: The system blocks the decision and displays an explanatory message.
* **8a**: Database error occurs while saving the decision  
  * **8a1**: The system displays a system error message and does not update the paper status.
* **9a**: Notification service fails after decision is saved  
  * **9a1**: The system informs the editor that notifications could not be sent; the decision remains stored (or is rolled back consistently, depending on design).

## Related Information
* **Priority**: High  
* **Frequency**: Once per paper  
* **Open Issues**:
  * The SRS does not specify whether conditional accept or revision decisions are supported.
  * The SRS does not specify whether decisions can be changed after notification.
