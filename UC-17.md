# Use Case UC-17: Edit generated conference schedule

**Goal in Context**: An editor edits a generated conference schedule so that conflicts can be resolved and the final schedule meets conference constraints.  
**Scope**: Conference Management System (CMS)  
**Level**: User Goal  
**Primary Actor**: Editor  
**Secondary Actors**: Database (schedule, sessions), Scheduling Rules Engine (conflict checks)  
**Trigger**: The editor selects an option to edit the generated schedule.

## Success End Condition
* The editor’s schedule changes are validated and saved, resulting in a conflict-free (or improved) schedule.

## Failed End Condition
* The schedule edits are not saved (or are saved incorrectly), conflicts remain unresolved, and the editor is informed of errors.

## Preconditions
* The editor is registered and authenticated.
* A schedule has been generated (draft or published, depending on policy).
* The editor has permission to modify the schedule.

## Main Success Scenario
1. The editor navigates to the conference scheduling section.
2. The editor opens the generated schedule in edit mode.
3. The system displays sessions, assigned papers, times, and locations, and highlights any detected conflicts.
4. The editor selects a conflicting session or paper assignment to modify.
5. The editor edits scheduling details (e.g., changes time slot, room, session assignment, or paper order).
6. The editor saves the changes.
7. The system validates the updated schedule against scheduling constraints (no overlap per room/time, valid time slots, etc.).
8. The system saves the updated schedule in the database.
9. The system confirms the schedule was updated successfully and shows the updated conflict status.

## Extensions
* **3a**: No conflicts exist in the schedule  
  * **3a1**: The system indicates the schedule is conflict-free; the editor may still make optional edits.
* **5a**: Editor creates a new conflict (e.g., overlapping sessions in same room)  
  * **5a1**: The system rejects the save and displays validation errors; the schedule remains unchanged.
* **5b**: Editor attempts an invalid edit (e.g., assigns a paper to a non-existent session/time slot)  
  * **5b1**: The system prevents the invalid edit or rejects the save with an explanatory message.
* **6a**: Editor cancels editing before saving  
  * **6a1**: The system discards unsaved changes and leaves the schedule unchanged.
* **8a**: Database error occurs while saving edits  
  * **8a1**: The system displays a system error message and does not persist changes.
* **2a**: Schedule is locked (e.g., already published and locked by policy)  
  * **2a1**: The system blocks editing and displays a message indicating the schedule cannot be edited.

## Related Information
* **Priority**: Medium–High  
* **Frequency**: Occasional during scheduling finalization  
* **Open Issues**:
  * The SRS does not define whether published schedules can be edited or require versioning.
  * The SRS does not specify the full set of schedule constraints beyond general conflict avoidance.
