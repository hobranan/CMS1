# Use Case UC-17: Edit Conference Schedule

## Goal
Authorized admins/editors modify an existing published schedule, save valid edits, and keep published visibility with updated last-edited metadata.

## Preconditions
- User is authenticated as admin/editor.
- Published schedule exists for conference.
- Schedule is not policy-locked.

## Main Flow
1. User opens schedule in edit mode.
2. System loads editable schedule details and current version.
3. User edits schedule entries.
4. User saves.
5. System validates edits, checks version, and persists transactionally.
6. System updates last-edited timestamp and returns updated schedule.

## Extensions
- Cancel before save: no changes persisted.
- Invalid references/conflicts: save rejected with explanatory feedback.
- Policy lock active: save blocked.
- Stale version: save rejected with reload instruction.
- DB failure: no persisted partial change.

## Success End Condition
Valid edits are saved; schedule remains published; latest edit timestamp is visible.

## Failure End Condition
No unintended schedule changes are persisted.
