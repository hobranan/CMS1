# Use Case UC-05: Submit paper manuscript with required metadata

**Goal in Context**: An author submits a new paper manuscript by providing required paper metadata and uploading a manuscript file so the paper can enter the conference review process.  
**Scope**: Conference Management System (CMS)  
**Level**: User Goal  
**Primary Actor**: Author (Registered User)  
**Secondary Actors**: Database (paper/metadata store), File Storage (manuscript upload storage, if separate)  
**Trigger**: The author requests to submit a new paper manuscript.

## Success End Condition
* The paper submission (metadata + manuscript file) is validated and stored, and the author receives confirmation that the submission has been accepted into the review workflow.

## Failed End Condition
* The submission is not stored (or not finalized), the paper does not enter the review process, and the author is informed of validation errors or system issues.

## Preconditions
* The author is registered and authenticated (logged in).
* The conference is accepting submissions (submission feature is available).
* The author has a manuscript file available in an allowed format and size.

## Main Success Scenario
1. The author selects the option to submit a new paper manuscript.
2. The system redirects the author to the manuscript submission page.
3. The system displays a submission form requesting required metadata and a manuscript upload.
4. The author enters the required metadata (author names, affiliations, contact information with valid primary email and optional phone, abstract, keywords, main source).
5. The author uploads a manuscript file in an allowed format (PDF, Word, or LaTeX) and within the allowed size limit.
6. The author submits the manuscript submission form.
7. The system validates that all required fields are complete and the uploaded file meets format and size constraints.
8. The system stores the submission metadata and the manuscript file reference in the database.
9. The system displays a success message and redirects the author to their home page.

## Extensions
* **4a**: One or more required metadata fields are missing or blank  
  * **4a1**: The system highlights missing fields, displays an error message, and prompts the author to complete the form.
* **4b**: One or more metadata fields contain invalid values (e.g., invalid email address, invalid characters)  
  * **4b1**: The system displays an error message indicating invalid fields and prompts correction.
* **5a**: No manuscript file is uploaded  
  * **5a1**: The system displays an error message indicating a manuscript file is required and prompts the author to upload a file.
* **5b**: Uploaded file format is not allowed (not PDF/Word/LaTeX)  
  * **5b1**: The system rejects the file, displays an error message about allowed formats, and prompts a re-upload.
* **5c**: Uploaded file exceeds the maximum allowed size  
  * **5c1**: The system rejects the upload, displays an error message about the size limit, and prompts a smaller file.
* **7a**: The system detects multiple validation errors in one submission  
  * **7a1**: The system rejects the submission, displays all actionable errors (or the first blocking error consistently), and keeps the author on the submission page.
* **8a**: The system cannot store the submission due to a database/storage error  
  * **8a1**: The system displays a system error message and advises the author to retry later; the submission is not finalized.

## Related Information
* **Priority**: High  
* **Frequency**: Occasional to frequent during the submission window (varies by conference timeline)  
* **Open Issues**:
  * The SRS lists required metadata fields but does not specify which are strictly mandatory vs. optional beyond “required information.”  
  * The SRS specifies allowed formats and a maximum size, but does not define how the system reports partial uploads or network interruptions.
