# Use Case UC-08: Assign referees to submitted paper

**Goal in Context**: An editor assigns up to three referees to a submitted paper so that the paper can be properly reviewed according to conference rules.  
**Scope**: Conference Management System (CMS)  
**Level**: User Goal  
**Primary Actor**: Editor  
**Secondary Actors**: Database (papers, referee assignments), Email/Notification Service (review invitations)  
**Trigger**: The editor selects the option to assign referees to a submitted paper.

## Success End Condition
* Up to three referees are successfully assigned to the paper, review invitations are sent, and the paper is ready for the review process.

## Failed End Condition
* Referees are not assigned (or assignment is incomplete), and the editor is informed of validation or system errors.

## Preconditions
* The editor is registered and authenticated.
* At least one paper has been submitted and is awaiting referee assignment.
* A list of eligible referees is available in the system.

## Main Success Scenario
1. The editor navigates to the list of submitted papers.
2. The editor selects a paper requiring referee assignment.
3. The system displays the referee assignment interface.
4. The editor selects up to three referees for the paper.
5. The system validates that no more than three referees are selected.
6. The system validates each selected referee workload in real time at confirmation using UC-09 limits from database configuration.
7. The editor confirms the assignment.
8. The system stores the referee assignments in the database.
9. The system sends review invitations to the assigned referees.
10. The system confirms successful assignment to the editor.

## Extensions
* **4a**: Editor selects more than three referees  
  * **4a1**: The system rejects the selection and displays an error message indicating the maximum of three referees.
* **6a**: A selected referee has exceeded the allowed number of assigned papers  
  * **6a1**: The system rejects that referee selection and informs the editor of the workload violation.
* **4b**: Selected referee is not eligible (e.g., not registered or not in referee list)  
  * **4b1**: The system displays an error message and prevents assignment of the invalid referee.
* **8a**: Database error occurs while saving assignments  
  * **8a1**: The system displays a system error message and does not finalize the assignment.
* **9a**: Notification service fails to send invitations  
  * **9a1**: The system informs the editor that invitations failed and rolls back the assignment so no partial assignment remains.

## Related Information
* **Priority**: High  
* **Frequency**: Frequent during the review setup phase  
* **Open Issues**:
  * The SRS specifies a maximum of three referees per paper and a maximum workload per referee, but does not define conflict-of-interest handling.
  * Partial assignments are not allowed; assignment remains all-or-nothing for the selected set.
