**Scope**: Conference Management System (CMS)  
**Level**: User Goal  
**Primary Actor**: Editor  
**Secondary Actors**: Database (reviews, assignments), Authorization Service (role/permissions)  
**Trigger**: The editor requests to view reviews for a submitted paper.

## Success End Condition

## Preconditions

3. The system displays the paper details and provides an option to view reviews.
4. The editor selects **View Reviews**.
