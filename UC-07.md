# Use Case UC-07: Save paper submission draft

**Goal in Context**: An author saves a partially completed paper submission so they can return later and complete the submission without losing entered information.  
**Scope**: Conference Management System (CMS)  
**Level**: User Goal  
**Primary Actor**: Author (Registered User)  
**Secondary Actors**: Database (submission draft store), File Storage (for any uploaded draft files)  
**Trigger**: The author selects the option to save the paper submission.

## Success End Condition
* The current state of the paper submission is saved as a draft and can be retrieved and edited later by the author.

## Failed End Condition
* The submission state is not saved, no draft is updated or created, and the author is informed of the failure.

## Preconditions
* The author is registered and authenticated (logged in).
* The author has started a paper submission.
* The submission has not yet been finalized and submitted for review.

## Main Success Scenario
1. The author is filling out the paper submission form.
2. The author selects the **Save** option at any point during submission.
3. The system validates the entered information for basic consistency (as required for saving).
4. The system stores the current submission state as a draft in the database.
5. The system confirms that the submission draft has been saved successfully.
6. The author may exit the submission process or continue editing.

## Extensions
* **2a**: No changes have been made since the last save  
  * **2a1**: The system informs the author that no new changes were detected and no update was required.
* **3a**: Entered data contains invalid values that prevent saving  
  * **3a1**: The system displays an error message indicating which fields must be corrected before saving.
* **4a**: The system cannot store the draft due to a database or storage error  
  * **4a1**: The system displays a system error message and advises the author to retry saving later.
* **4b**: Network interruption occurs during save  
  * **4b1**: The system informs the author that the save failed due to connectivity issues and prompts a retry.

## Related Information
* **Priority**: High  
* **Frequency**: Frequent during paper preparation  
* **Open Issues**:
  * The SRS does not clearly specify which validation rules apply when saving drafts versus final submission.
  * The SRS does not specify whether autosave is supported in addition to manual save.
