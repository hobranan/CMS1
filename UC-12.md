# Use Case UC-12: Submit completed review

**Goal in Context**: A referee submits a completed review form for an assigned paper so the editor can consider the review when making an accept/reject decision.  
**Scope**: Conference Management System (CMS)  
**Level**: User Goal  
**Primary Actor**: Referee (Registered User)  
**Secondary Actors**: Database (reviews, assignments), Notification Service (notify editor of submitted review)  
**Trigger**: The referee chooses to submit a completed review for an assigned paper.

## Success End Condition
* The review is validated and stored as submitted, the assignment status reflects completion, and the editor can view the submitted review.

## Failed End Condition
* The review is not submitted (or not marked as submitted), no final review record is stored, and the referee is informed of the failure.

## Preconditions
* The referee is registered and authenticated (logged in).
* The referee has an active assignment for the paper (invitation accepted).
* The review form for the paper is accessible and editable by the referee.
* The review has been completed to the extent required by the system (required fields filled).

## Main Success Scenario
1. The referee navigates to their **Assigned Papers** list.
2. The referee selects an assigned paper and opens its review form.
3. The referee completes all required review fields (e.g., ratings, comments, recommendation).
4. The referee selects **Submit Review**.
5. The system validates that all required review fields are complete and within allowed constraints.
6. The system stores the review in the database and marks it as submitted (read-only thereafter).
7. The system updates the assignment/review status to indicate the review is completed.
8. The system notifies the editor that a review has been submitted (if notifications are enabled).
9. The system displays confirmation to the referee that the review was submitted successfully.

## Extensions
* **3a**: Review form is incomplete (missing required fields)  
  * **3a1**: The system prevents submission and highlights missing/invalid fields with an error message.
* **4a**: Referee cancels submission (e.g., closes confirmation dialog)  
  * **4a1**: The system makes no changes; the review remains in draft state.
* **5a**: Review submission deadline has passed or assignment is no longer active  
  * **5a1**: The system blocks submission and displays a message indicating the review cannot be submitted.
* **6a**: Database error occurs while saving the submitted review  
  * **6a1**: The system displays a system error message; the review remains unsubmitted.
* **8a**: Notification service fails after review is submitted  
  * **8a1**: The system informs the referee that notifications could not be sent; the review remains submitted (or is rolled back consistently, depending on design).

## Related Information
* **Priority**: High  
* **Frequency**: Frequent during review period  
* **Open Issues**:
  * The SRS does not specify deadlines or late-review handling rules.
  * The SRS does not specify whether submitted reviews can be edited or withdrawn.
