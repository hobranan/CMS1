# Use Case UC-18: View final conference schedule

**Goal in Context**: An attendee or author views the final conference schedule so they can plan participation and know when/where presentations occur.  
**Scope**: Conference Management System (CMS)  
**Level**: User Goal  
**Primary Actor**: Attendee / Author  
**Secondary Actors**: Database (published schedule), Authorization Service (access control)  
**Trigger**: The attendee/author requests to view the conference schedule.

## Success End Condition
* The user can access and view the published (final) conference schedule, including sessions, times, locations, and paper presentation details.

## Failed End Condition
* The user cannot view the schedule (or only partial information is available), and the system informs the user of the reason.

## Preconditions
* A conference schedule exists.
* The schedule has been published as final (or is otherwise available for viewing).
* The user has access rights to view the schedule (public or authenticated access per policy).

## Main Success Scenario
1. The attendee/author navigates to the **Conference Schedule** page.
2. The system retrieves the published schedule from the database.
3. The system displays the schedule, organized by day/session, showing times, locations, and presentation listings.
4. The attendee/author browses the schedule and selects a session or presentation for more details.
5. The system displays the selected session/presentation details (e.g., title, authors, abstract if available, time, location).
6. The attendee/author may return to the schedule view and continue browsing.

## Extensions
* **1a**: Schedule is not yet published/final  
  * **1a1**: The system displays a message indicating the schedule is not available yet.
* **2a**: System cannot retrieve schedule due to database error  
  * **2a1**: The system displays a system error message and advises retry later.
* **4a**: User attempts to view restricted details (policy-based)  
  * **4a1**: The system hides restricted fields and/or prompts the user to log in if required.
* **5a**: Selected session/presentation details are missing or incomplete  
  * **5a1**: The system displays available information and indicates that some details are unavailable.

## Related Information
* **Priority**: Medium–High  
* **Frequency**: High near conference dates  
* **Open Issues**:
  * The SRS does not specify whether the schedule is publicly accessible or requires authentication.
  * The SRS does not specify export formats (PDF/iCal) or filtering/search capabilities.
