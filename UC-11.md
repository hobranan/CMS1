# Use Case UC-11: Access assigned papers and review forms

**Goal in Context**: A referee accesses their assigned papers and the corresponding review forms so they can evaluate submissions and prepare reviews.  
**Scope**: Conference Management System (CMS)  
**Level**: User Goal  
**Primary Actor**: Referee (Registered User)  
**Secondary Actors**: Database (assignments, review forms), File Storage (paper manuscripts), Authorization Service (role/permissions)  
**Trigger**: The referee requests to view assigned papers or open a review form.

## Success End Condition
* The referee can view their list of assigned papers, open a selected paper’s manuscript, and access the associated review form.

## Failed End Condition
* The referee cannot access one or more requested resources (paper list, manuscript, or review form), and the system informs the referee of the reason.

## Preconditions
* The referee is registered and authenticated (logged in).
* The referee has at least one active assignment (e.g., has accepted an invitation or has been assigned).
* The paper manuscript and review form exist in the system for the assignment.

## Main Success Scenario
1. The referee navigates to their **Assigned Papers** section.
2. The system retrieves and displays the list of papers assigned to the referee.
3. The referee selects a specific assigned paper.
4. The system displays the paper details and provides access links to the manuscript and review form.
5. The referee opens/downloads the manuscript file.
6. The referee opens the review form for the selected paper.
7. The system displays the review form, ready for the referee to complete.

## Extensions
* **2a**: Referee has no assigned papers
* **2b**: The system informs the referee that there are no assigned papers.
* **3a**: Referee attempts to access a paper not assigned to them (unauthorized)
  * **3a1**: The system blocks access and displays an authorization error message.
* **3b**: Manuscript file is unavailable (missing, deleted, or storage error)
  * **3b1**: The system displays an error message indicating the manuscript cannot be accessed and advises retry later.
* **2c**: Review form is unavailable (not generated or database error)
  * **2c1**: The system displays an error message indicating the review form cannot be accessed and advises retry later.
* **2d**: System cannot retrieve assigned papers list (database error)
  * **2d1**: The system displays a system error message and prevents access to the list.
## Related Information
* **Priority**: High  
* **Frequency**: Frequent during the review period  
* **Open Issues**:
  * Manuscript access is view-only for assigned referees in this flow.
  * Review forms are pre-generated and not created on first access in this flow.
