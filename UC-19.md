# Use Case UC-19: View conference registration prices

**Goal in Context**: A guest or registered user views conference registration prices so they can decide whether to attend the conference.  
**Scope**: Conference Management System (CMS)  
**Level**: User Goal  
**Primary Actor**: Guest / Registered User  
**Secondary Actors**: Database (registration fees, categories), Authorization Service (access control, if needed)  
**Trigger**: The user requests to view conference registration pricing information.

## Success End Condition
* The user can view current registration prices, including categories (e.g., student, regular, early/late), and any relevant conditions.

## Failed End Condition
* The user cannot view registration prices, or only partial information is available, and the system informs the user of the reason.

## Preconditions
* Registration pricing information exists in the system.
* The pricing information is marked as visible to guests and/or registered users.

## Main Success Scenario
1. The guest or registered user navigates to the **Registration Prices** page.
2. The system retrieves current registration pricing information from the database.
3. The system displays registration categories and corresponding prices (e.g., student, regular, early/late).
4. The user reviews the pricing information.
5. The user may navigate away or proceed to registration (if available).

## Extensions
* **1a**: Registration prices are not yet published  
  * **1a1**: The system displays a message indicating that pricing information is not available yet.
* **2a**: System cannot retrieve pricing information due to database error  
  * **2a1**: The system displays a system error message and advises retry later.
* **3a**: Some pricing categories are missing or incomplete  
  * **3a1**: The system displays available prices and indicates that some information is unavailable.
* **1b**: Access to prices is restricted (policy-based)  
  * **1b1**: The system prompts the user to log in or displays limited pricing information according to policy.

## Related Information
* **Priority**: Medium  
* **Frequency**: High before registration deadlines  
* **Open Issues**:
  * The SRS does not specify whether prices are public or require authentication.
  * The SRS does not specify currency handling or discounts (e.g., early-bird).
