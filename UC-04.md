# Use Case UC-04: Change password

**Goal in Context**: A registered user changes their account password so they can maintain account security while continuing to access CMS features.  
**Scope**: Conference Management System (CMS)  
**Level**: User Goal  
**Primary Actor**: Registered User  
**Secondary Actors**: Database (credential store)  
**Trigger**: The user requests to change their password.

## Success End Condition
* The user’s password is updated in the credential store, and the user receives confirmation that the change was successful.

## Failed End Condition
* The user’s password is not changed, the previous password remains valid, and the user is informed of the reason for failure.

## Preconditions
* The user has a registered account in the CMS.
* The user is authenticated (logged in) and has access to account settings/password change functionality.

## Main Success Scenario
1. The registered user navigates to account settings and selects **Change Password**.
2. The system displays a change-password form requesting the current password, the new password, and password confirmation.
3. The user enters their current password and a new password and submits the form.
4. The system validates that the required fields are provided.
5. The system verifies the current password matches the stored credential for the user.
6. The system validates the new password against password security standards.
7. The system updates the user’s password in the database.
8. The system displays a confirmation message indicating the password was changed successfully.

## Extensions
* **3a**: One or more required fields are missing  
  * **3a1**: The system displays an error message indicating missing required fields and prompts the user to complete them.
* **5a**: Current password does not match  
  * **5a1**: The system displays an error message indicating the current password is incorrect and prompts the user to try again.
* **6a**: New password does not meet password security standards  
  * **6a1**: The system displays an error message describing the password requirements and prompts the user to enter a different password.
* **3b**: New password confirmation does not match  
  * **3b1**: The system displays an error message indicating the new password and confirmation do not match and prompts the user to re-enter them.
* **7a**: The system cannot update the credential store (database/service error)  
  * **7a1**: The system displays an error message indicating a system problem and advises the user to retry later.

## Related Information
* **Priority**: High  
* **Frequency**: Occasional (whenever users need to update credentials)  
* **Open Issues**:
  * The SRS references “Password Security Standards” but does not specify exact rules (length, complexity, reuse, etc.).  
  * The SRS does not specify whether the system requires re-authentication or session invalidation after a password change.
