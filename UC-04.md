# Use Case UC-04: Change Account Password

**Goal in Context**: An authenticated user changes account password securely while preserving account integrity.  
**Scope**: Conference Management System (CMS)  
**Level**: User Goal  
**Primary Actor**: User  
**Secondary Actors**: CMS services, data store  
**Trigger**: The primary actor initiates this use case.

## Success End Condition
* Password is updated securely, old password no longer authenticates, and user reauthenticates with new password.

## Failed End Condition
* Password remains unchanged and user receives explicit correction/retry guidance.

## Preconditions
* User is authenticated.
* User has access to account password-change form.

## Main Success Scenario
1. User opens change-password form.
2. User submits current password, new password, and confirmation.
3. System validates required fields and confirmation match.
4. System verifies current password.
5. System validates new password policy and history restrictions.
6. System updates password atomically.
7. System confirms success.
8. System invalidates active session and requires re-authentication.

## Extensions
* **3a**: Missing fields: reject with required-field feedback.
* **3b**: Incorrect current password: reject with incorrect-current-password feedback.
* **3c**: Policy violations (weak, history reuse, current equals new): reject with policy guidance.
* **3d**: Confirmation mismatch: reject with mismatch guidance.
* **6a**: Credential store failure: reject with retry-later message and no partial update.
